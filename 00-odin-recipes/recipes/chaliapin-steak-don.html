    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The dish is exclusively made by S≈çma combined with the Japanese original
      dish, the Chaliapin Steak and the donburi concept for his first Shokugeki.
      Although the dish was made with cheap ingredients that can be found in a
      supermarket, the dish focused on both innovation and balance of the
      ingredients to fulfill the donburi mantra, "Dons are completed in one
      bowl."

    <h2>How to Cook</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Chop the onions finely.</li>
      <li>
        Remove the tendons from the beef and beat it with a meat tenderizer
        until as flat as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover meat on both sides with the chopped onion and leave for 30 minutes
        or more. Remove the onion and add salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the steak to your preference(most would prefer medium-rare). Remove
        from heat and melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan and fry the
        onion used for the beef until it changes color. Adjust the flavor with
        salt and pepper, then move the onion to the steak.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the remaining butter in the frying pan and fry the sides of the
        meat before taking it out.
      </li>
    </ol>
